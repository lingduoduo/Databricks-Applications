Pitt was named People's Sexiest Man Alive in 1995 and 2000.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nWilliam Bradley Pitt was born on December 18, 1963, in Shawnee, Oklahoma, to William Alvin Pitt, the proprietor of a trucking company, and Jane Etta (née Hillhouse), a school counselor. The family soon moved to Springfield, Missouri, where he lived together with his younger siblings, Douglas Pitt (born 1966) and Julie (née Pitt) Neal (born 1969). Born into a conservative Christian household, he was raised as Southern Baptist and later \"oscillate[d] between agnosticism and atheism\". He later reconciled his belief in spirituality. Pitt has described Springfield as \"Mark Twain country, Jesse James country\", having grown up with \"a lot of hills, a lot of lakes\".\nPitt attended Kickapoo High School, where he was a member of the golf, swimming, and tennis teams. He participated in the school's Key and Forensics clubs, in school debates, and in musicals. Following his graduation from high school, Pitt enrolled in the University of Missouri in 1982, majoring in journalism with a focus on advertising. As graduation approached, Pitt did not feel ready to settle down. He loved films—\"a portal into different worlds for me\"—and, since films were not made in Missouri, he decided to go to where they were made. Two weeks short of completing the coursework for a degree, Pitt left the university and moved to Los Angeles, where he took acting lessons and worked odd jobs. He has named Gary Oldman, Sean Penn, and Mickey Rourke as his early acting heroes.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early work (1987–1993) ===\nWhile struggling to establish himself in Los Angeles, Pitt took lessons from acting coach Roy London. His acting career began in 1987, with uncredited parts in the films No Way Out (1987), No Man's Land (1987) and Less than Zero (1987). In May 1987, he made his television debut in a two-episode role on the NBC soap opera Another World. In November of the same year, Pitt had a guest appearance on the CBS sitcom Trial and Error and the' metadata={'title': 'Brad Pitt', 'summary': \"William Bradley Pitt (born December 18, 1963) is an American actor and film producer.

I’ll discuss the differences between the ABAC and legacy Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) approaches to control access and how the RBAC approach is not sufficient to keep up with today’s growing big data market. With so much data available, there also comes substantial risk. Data can contain many sensitive data elements, including PII and PHI. Industry leaders like Databricks are pushing the boundaries of data technology, which leads to constantly evolving data use cases. And that’s a good thing! However, the RBAC approach is struggling to keep up with those advancements.\n",
       " So what is RBAC? It’s an approach to data access that permits system access based on the end-user’s role. For legacy systems, it’s meant as a simple but effective approach to securing data. Are you a manager? Then you’ll get access to data meant for managers. This is great for small deployments with clearly defined roles. Here at Booz Allen, we invested in Databricks because we have an environment of over 30k users and billions of rows of data.\n",
       " To mitigate this problem and align with our forward-thinking company standard, we introduced Immuta into our stack. Immuta uses ABAC to allow for dynamic data access control. Users are automatically assigned certain attributes, and access is based on those attributes instead of just their role. This allows for more flexibility and allows data access control to easily scale without the need to constantly map a user to their role. Using attributes, we can write policies in one place and have them applied across all of our data platforms. This makes for a truly holistic data governance approach and provides immediate ROI and time savings for the company.</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Increasing Trust in Your Data: Enabling a Data Governance Program on Databricks Using Unity Catalog and ML-Driven MDM</td><td>As part of Comcast Effectv’s transformation into a completely digital advertising agency, it was key to develop an approach to manage and remediate data quality issues related to customer data so that the sales organization is using reliable data to enable data-driven decision making.

Powered by cutting edge science, we leverage first-party retail data from nearly one out of two US households totaling over 2B transactions a year. Databricks is integral to the data science and machine learning work at 84.51° and manages 35+ PB of first-party customer data across 150+ Databricks workspaces. Before Unity Catalog, this data was structured in a decentralized data mesh which had issues including problematic data sharing, minimal data governance, and no auditing of data extracts. In this session, we will discuss how 84.51° incrementally rolled out Unity Catalog company-wide in a way that involved minimal disruption of existing processes and how UC-enabled solutions solved several real-world problems including:\n",
       " • Being able to migrate an on-prem solution to a Databricks SQL Warehouse with HIPAA auditing and data governance which resulted in reduced on-prem costs and enabled new solutions/products to bring significant new revenue sources. \n",
       " • Leveraging Delta Sharing to eliminate duplication of data and processing and enabling new insights to provide a deeper, more personal approach to customer engagement.\n",
       "Databricks has also been key to the 84.51° Collaborative Cloud, which provides our clients' data scientists a platform that provides clean and ready-to-use transaction and UPC-level data from 60 million households empowering companies to get value out of data science, regardless of where they sit on the readiness spectrum. Unity Catalog will be key to extend the collaborative cloud functionality and cleanroom technology with improved security and governance.</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>Lakehouse as a FAIR Platform</td><td>FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) data and data platforms are becoming more and more important in public sector. Lakehouse platform is strongly aligned with these principles. Lakehouse provides tools required to both adhere to FAIR but also to FAIRify data that isn't FAIR compliant. In this session we will cover parts of the lakehouse that enable end users to FAIRify data products, how to build good robust data products and which parts of Lakehouse align to which principles in FAIR. We'll demonstrate how DLT is crucial for data transformations on nonFAIR data, how Unity Catalog unlocks discoverability (F) and governed data access (A), and how marketplace, cleanrooms and Delta Sharing unlock interoperability and data exchange (I and R). All of these concepts are massive enablers for highly regulated industries such as Public Sector. It undeniably important to align Lakehouse to standards that are widely adopted by standards and policy makers and regulators. These principles transcend all industries and all use cases.</td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td>Engineers Shouldn't Write Data Governance Policies</td><td>Controlling permissions for accessing data assets can be messy, time consuming, and usually a combination of both. The teams responsible for creating the business rules that govern who should have access to what data are usually different from the teams responsible for administering the grants to achieve that access. On the other side of the equation, the end user who needs access to a data asset may be left waiting for grants to be made as the decision is passed between teams. That is, if they even know the correct path to getting access in the first place.\n",
       "  \n",
       " Separating the concerns of managing data governance at a business level and implementing data governance at an engineering level is the best way to clarify data access permissions. In practice, this involves building systems to enable data governance enforcement based on business rules, with little to no understanding of the individual system where the data lives. \n",
       " \n",
       " In practice, with a concrete business rule, such as “only users from the finance team should have access to critical financial data,” we want a system that deals only with those constituent concepts. For example, “the data is marked as critical financial” and “the user is a part of the finance team”). By abstracting away any source system components, such as “the tables in the finance schema” and “someone who’s a member of the finance databricks group,” the access policies applied will then model the business rules as closely as possible.\n",

       " In this talk, we will briefly cover the basics of Spark/Parquet encryption usage, and dive into the details of encryption key management that will help in integrating this Spark data protection mechanism in your deployment. You will learn how to run a HelloWorld encryption sample, and how to extend it into a real world production code integrated with your organization’s KMS and access control policies. We will talk about the standard envelope encryption approach to big data protection, the performance-vs-security trade-offs between single and double envelope wrapping, internal and external key metadata storage. We will see a demo, and discuss the new features such as uniform encryption and two-tier management of encryption keys.</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Enabling Data Governance at Enterprise Scale Using Unity Catalog</td><td>For some time, Amgen has been building multiple enterprise platforms on the latest technology with a key focus on tech rationalization, data democratization, overall user experience, increase reusability and cost-effectiveness. One of these platforms is the enterprise data fabric platform. This platform specifically focuses on pulling in data across functions into a single platform building capabilities around the connectedness of data, and access governance.\n",
       " For a while, we have been trying to setup robust data governance capabilities which are simple, yet easy to manage through Databricks. As part of this process we evaluated products like privacera, Immuta, and Okera. While these tools could solve a few immediate needs like managing tables and database level, for the use cases like maintaining governance on highly restricted data domains like EDW(Finance) and Workday(HR), we felt that for the long term we will require a more Databricks native solution because of below reasons:\n",
       " - There were ways to bypass these tools on databricks cluster\n",
       " - Unsupported DBR runtime\n",
       " - Complexity of fine-grained security\n",
       " - Policy management – AWS IAM + Intool policies\n",
       "  To address these challenges, and for large-scale enterprise adoption of our governance capability, we started working on UC integration with our governance processes. Following tech benefits we realized:\n",
       " - Independent of Databricks runtime\n",
       " - Easy fine-grained access control\n",
       " - Eliminated management of IAM roles\n",
       " - Dynamic access control using UC and dynamic views\n",
       " As a result of these technical benefits, we were able to implement fine-grained and complex governance policies around the restricted data set of Amgen including Finance and Workday. At this point we have around 100K objects mapped in the Unity Catalog and growing rapidly.</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>Lineage System Table in Unity Catalog</td><td>Unity Catalog provides fully automated data lineage for all workloads in SQL, R, Python, Scala and across all asset types at Databricks. The aggregated view has been available to end users through data explorer and API. In this session, we are excited to share that lineage is available via delta table in their UC metastore. It stores full history of recent lineage records and it is near real time. Additionally, customers can query it through standard SQL interface. With that, customers can get significant operational insights about their workload for impact analysis, troubleshooting, quality assurance, data discovery, and data governance. Together with the system table platform effort, which provides query history, job run operational data, audit logs and more, lineage table will be a critical piece to link all the data asset and entity asset together. It will provide better Lakehouse observability and unification to customers.</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>Combining Privacy Solutions to Solve Data Access at Scale</td><td>The trend that has made data easier to collect and analyze, has only aggravated privacy risks. Luckily, a range of privacy technologies have emerged to enable private data management (differential privacy, synthetic data, confidential computing).  In isolation, those technologies have had a limited impact because they did not always bring the 10x improvement expected by data leaders.\n",
       " \n",
       " Combining these privacy technologies has been the real game changer. We will demonstrate that the right mix of technologies brings the optimal balance of privacy and flexibility at the scale of the data warehouse.

The sheer number of enterprise cybersecurity toolsets, each capturing and generating its own data, creates significant data management and data engineering challenges for all enterprises. Because each of these security tools has separate logs, outputs, and databases, it prevents any security team from meaningfully understanding their overall security posture and using their own data effectively. We believe that cybersecurity is fundamentally a data management problem. In this presentation, we will show how treating cybersecurity as a data management problem, and subsequently opening disparate cybersecurity data to queries can help organizations secure their systems and data more effectively.

It happened to be aggregations using DataFrame.groupBy operation with a custom Scala UDAF over a data stream from Kafka. Just a single simple-looking request that turned itself up into a a-few-month-long hunt to find a more performant query execution planning than ObjectHashAggregateExec that kept falling back to a sort-based aggregation (i.e. the worst possible aggregation runtime performance). It quickly taught us that an aggregation using a custom Scala UDAF cannot be planned other than ObjectHashAggregateExec but at least tasks don't always have to fall back. And that's just batch workloads. When you throw in streaming semantics and think of the different output modes, windowing and streaming watermark optimizing aggregation can take a long time to do right.\n",

However, many such turn-key solutions face challenges: cost-inefficient EDW targets; inability to evolve schema; forbiddingly expensive data exports due to cloud and vendor lock-in. The alternative: an open data lake that unifies batch and streaming workloads. Increasingly, we must adapt to a multi-cloud reality. Delta Lake decouples data storage from proprietary formats, dramatically reducing data extraction costs. Exporting data from delta tables eliminates the compute and storage API costs required by EDW. Bronze landing zones in Delta format build the foundation for a medallion architecture. Apache Spark™ Structured Streaming provides a unified ingestion strategy. Streaming triggers allow us to switch back and forth between batch and stream with one-line code changes. Streaming aggregation enables us to incrementally compute on data that arrives near each other.\n",
       " It is a misconception that streaming requires always-on clusters and thus is prohibitively expensive. Streaming means the ability to automatically handle new data and avoid reprocessing of historical data; real time is optional depending on use cases. Autoloader is a technique to discover newly arrived data and ensure exactly once, incremental processing. DLT further simplifies streaming jobs, accelerating the development cycle.\n",
       " Workflows bring it all together and the open source dbx project applies SWE best practices. Workflows can orchestrate tasks such as DLT pipelines, spark jobs, SQL scripts, as well as dbt transformations. Developers can define compute resources, scheduling, and dependencies in descriptive yaml format.

Few of these applications are driving critical business use cases like financial fraud detection, loan application processing, personalized offers, etc. These business critical applications need robust disaster recovery strategies to recover from the catastrophic events to reduce the lost uptime. However, most organizations find it hard to set up disaster recovery for streaming applications as it involves continuous data flow. Streaming state and temporal behavior of data brings additional complexities to the DR strategy.\n",
       " \n",
       " A reliable disaster recovery strategy includes backup, failover and failback approaches for the streaming application. Unlike the batch applications, these steps include many moving elements and need a very sophisticated approach to ensure that the services are failing over the DR region and meet the set RTO and RPO requirements.

Though we have up-to-date data in OLTP databases, they cannot support those scenarios. Data need to be replicated to a data warehouse to serve queries doing group-bys, and joins across tables from different systems. At Coinbase, we designed SOON (Spark cOntinuOus iNgestion) based on Kafka, Kafka Connect, and Spark as an incremental table replication solution to replicate tables of any size from any database to Delta Lake in a timely manner. It also supports Kafka events ingestion naturally.\n",
       " \n",
       " SOON incrementally ingests Kafka events as appends, updates, and deletes to an existing table on Delta Lake. The events are grouped into two categories: CDC (change data capture) events generated by Kafka Connect source connectors, and non-CDC events by the frontend or backend services. Both types can be appended or merged into the Delta Lake. Non-CDC events can be in any format, but CDC events must be in the standard SOON CDC schema. We implemented Kafka Connect SMTs to transform raw CDC events into this standardized format. SOON unifies all streaming ingestion scenarios such that users only need to learn one onboarding experience and the team only needs to maintain one framework.\n",

The client had a previous bad experience with another vendor, who overpromised and underdelivered on the latency of the streaming solution. The previous vendor delivered an over-complex streaming data pipeline resulting in the data taking over 5 minutes to reach a visualization layer. The client felt that architecture was too complex and involved many services integrated together. Our immediate challenges involved gaining the client's trust and proving that our design and implementation quality would supercede a previous experience.

By the multi-fold performance improvement from these solutions, more and more Spark users have started to adopt the new technology. One characteristics of native libraries is that they all use columnar data format as the basic data format. It's because the columnar data format has the intrinsic affinity to vectorized data processing using SIMD instructions. While vanilla Spark's shuffle is based on spark's internal row data format. The high overhead of the columnar to row and row to columnar conversion during the shuffle makes reusing current shuffle not possible. Due to the importance of shuffle service in Spark, we have to implement an efficient columnar shuffle, which brings couple of new challenges, like the split of columnar data, or the dictionary support during shuffle.\n",

Should the model be univariate or multivariate? What features warrant the best model inputs? What model type should you choose? Are the best hyperparameters selected? All of these parts of the modeling process can be quite costly in terms of both time and computational resources. In this session, you will see solution we've created called DEIMOS (Deep Experimental Integrated Multivariate Optimized Series). DEIMOS is built to handle many of the critical problems in time-series modeling automatically and at scale.

While developing ML models is technically possible using either platform, the Hitachi Solutions Empower team tested which solution will be easier, faster, and cheaper to work with in terms of both user experience and business outcomes for our customers. To do this, we designed and conducted a series of experiments with use cases from the TPCx-AI benchmark standard. We developed both single-node and multi-node versions of these experiments, which sometimes required us to set up separate compute infrastructure outside of the platform, in the case of Snowflake. We also built datasets of various sizes (1GB, 10GB, and 100GB), to assess how each platform/node setup handles scale. Based on our findings. On the average, Databricks is faster, cheaper, and easier to use for developing machine learning models, and we use it exclusively for data science on the Empower platform. Snowflake’s reliance on third party resources for distributed training is a major drawback, and the need to use multiple compute environments to scale up training is complex and, in our view, an unnecessary complication to achieve best results.</td><td>162</td></tr><tr><td>Testing Generative AI Models - What You Need to Know</td><td>Generative AI shows incredible promise for enterprise applications.

However, they typically do not decouple compute and storage, making them hard to integrate in production data stacks. Because data storage in these databases is expensive and not easily accessible, data teams typically maintain ETL pipelines to offload historical embedding data to blob stores. When that data needs to be queried, they get loaded back into the vector database in another ETL process. This is reminiscent of loading data from OLTP database to cloud storage, then loading said data into an OLAP warehouse for offline analytics. Recently, “lakehouse” offerings allow direct OLAP querying on cloud storage, removing the need for the second ETL step. The same could be done for embedding data. While embedding storage in blob stores cannot satisfy the high TPS requirements in online settings, we argue it’s sufficient for offline analytics use cases like slicing and dicing data based on embedding clusters. Instead of loading the embedding data back into the vector database for offline analytics, we propose direct processing on embeddings stored in Parquet files in Delta Lake. You will see that offline embedding workloads typically touch a large portion of the stored embeddings without the need for random access. As a result, the workload is entirely bound by network throughput instead of latency, making it quite suitable for blob storage backends. On a test 1 billion vector dataset, ETL into cloud storage takes around 1 hour on a dedicated GPU instance, while batched nearest neighbor search can be done in under one minute with four CPU instances. We believe future “lakehouses” will ship with native support for these embedding workloads.</td><td>169</td></tr><tr><td>JoinBoost: In-DB ML for Tree-Models</td><td>Data and Machine Learning (ML) are crucial for enterprise operations. Enterprises store data in databases for management and use ML to gain business insights. However, there is a mismatch between the way ML expects data to be organized (a single table) and the way data is organized in databases (a join graph of multiple tables) and leads to inefficiencies when joining and materializing tables. In this session, you will see how we successfully address this issue. We introduce JoinBoost, a lightweight python library that trains tree models (such as random forests and gradient boosting) for join graphs in databases. JoinBoost acts as a query rewriting layer that is compatible with cloud databases, and eliminates the need for costly join materialization.</td><td>170</td></tr><tr><td>Demonstrate-Search-Predict: Composing Retrieval and Language Models for Knowledge-Intensive NLP</td><td>In this session, you will learn about how retrieval-augmented in-context learning has emerged as a powerful approach for addressing knowledge-intensive tasks using frozen language models (LM) and retrieval models (RM). Existing work has combined these in simple “retrieve-then-read” pipelines in which the RM retrieves passages that are inserted into the LM prompt. To begin to fully realize the potential of frozen LMs and RMs, we propose Demonstrate–Search–Predict (DSP), a framework that relies on passing natural language texts in sophisticated pipelines between an LM and an RM. DSP can express high-level programs that bootstrap pipeline-aware demonstrations, search for relevant passages, and generate grounded predictions, systematically breaking down problems into small transformations that the LM and RM can handle more reliably. We have written novel DSP programs for answering questions in open-domain, multi-hop, and conversational settings, establishing in early evaluations new state-of-the-art in-context learning results and delivering 37–125%, 8–40%, and 80–290% relative gains against vanilla LMs, a standard retrieve-then-read pipeline, and a contemporaneous self-ask pipeline, respectively.</td><td>171</td></tr><tr><td>Data Caching Strategies for Data Analytics and AI</td><td>The increasing popularity of data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) has led to a dramatic increase in the volume of data being used in these fields, creating a growing need for an enhanced computational capability. Cache plays a crucial role as an accelerator for data and AI computations, but it is important to note that these domains have different data access patterns, requiring different cache strategies. In this session, you will see our observations on data access patterns in the analytical SQL and AI training domains based on practical experience with large-scale systems. We will discuss the evaluation results of various caching strategies for analytical SQL and AI and provide caching recommendations for different use cases. Over the years, we have learned some best practices from big internet companies about the following aspects of our journey: 1. Traffic pattern for analytical SQL and cache strategy recommendation, 2. Traffic pattern for AI training and how we can measure the cache efficiency for different AI training process, 3. Cache capacity planning based on real-time metrics of the working set, and 4. Adaptive caching admission and eviction for uncertain traffic patterns</td><td>172</td></tr><tr><td>If a Duck Quacks in the Forrest and Everyone Hears, Should you Care?</td><td>\"YES! \"\"Duck posting\"\" has become an internet meme for praising DuckDB on twitter.

We introduced pandas API on Spark, and hugely improved usability such as error messages, type hints, etc., and PySpark has become almost the very standard of distributed computing in Python.\n",
       " \n",
       " With this trend, the kind of PySpark use cases became also very complicated especially for modern data applications such as notebooks, IDEs, even devices such as smart home devices leveraging the power of data, that virtually need a lightweight separate client. However, today’s PySpark client is considerably heavy, and does not allow the separation from its scheduler, optimizer and analyzer as an example.\n",

However, Spark's driver architecture is monolithic, with no built-in capability to directly connect to a remote Spark cluster from languages other than SQL. This makes it hard to enable such interactive developer experiences from a user’s local IDE of choice. Spark Connect’s decoupled client-server architecture introduces remote connectivity to Spark clusters and with that, enables interactive development experience - Spark and its open ecosystem can be leveraged from everywhere! \n",

       "</td><td>Cybersecurity incidents are costly, and using an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution enables the detection of cybersecurity incidents as quickly as possible. To effectively detect cybersecurity incidences requires the collection of millions of data points, and the storing/querying of endpoints data presents considerable engineering challenges. This includes quickly moving local data from endpoints to a single table in the cloud and enabling performant querying against it. The need to avoid internal data siloing within BlackBerry was paramount as multiple teams required access to the data to deliver an effective EDR solution for the present and the future. Databricks tooling enabled us to break down our data silos and iteratively improve our EDR pipeline to ingest data faster and reduce querying latency by more than 20% while reducing costs by more than 30%.\n",

         "Instacart has gone through immense growth during the pandemic and the trend continues. Instacart ads is no exception in this growth story. We have launched many new product lines including display and video ads covering the full advertising funnel to address the increasing demand of our retail partners. We have built advanced models to auto-suggest optimal bidding to increase the ROI for our CPG partners. Advertisers’ trust is the utmost priority and thus the quest to build a top-class ads measurement platform.\n \n Ads data processing requires complex data verifications to update ads serving stats. In ETL pipelines these were implemented through files containing thousands of lines of raw SQL which were hard to scale, test, and iterate upon. Our data engineers used to spend hours testing small changes due to a lack of local testing mechanisms. \n \n These pain points stress our need for better tools. After some research, we chose Apache Spark™ as our preferred tool to rebuild ETLs, and the Databricks platform made this move easier. In this presentation, I will share our journey to move our pipelines to Spark and Delta Lake on Databricks. With spark, scala, and delta we solved many problems which were slowing the team’s productivity. Some key areas I will cover include:\n - Modular and composable code\n - Unit testing framework\n - Incremental event processing with spark structured streaming \n - Granular resource tuning for better performance and cost efficacy\n \n Other than the domain business logic, the problems discussed here are quite common for performing data processing at scale. I would be glad to have the opportunity to share our learning and am hopeful that it will benefit others who are going through similar growth challenges or migrating to Lakehouse.",

Industry leaders like Databricks are pushing the boundaries of data technology, which leads to constantly evolving data use cases. And that’s a good thing! However, the RBAC approach is struggling to keep up with those advancements.\n So what is RBAC? It’s an approach to data access that permits system access based on the end-user’s role. For legacy systems, it’s meant as a simple but effective approach to securing data. Are you a manager? Then you’ll get access to data meant for managers. This is great for small deployments with clearly defined roles. Here at Booz Allen, we invested in Databricks because we have an environment of over 30k users and billions of rows of data.\n To mitigate this problem and align with our forward-thinking company standard, we introduced Immuta into our stack. Immuta uses ABAC to allow for dynamic data access control. Users are automatically assigned certain attributes, and access is based on those attributes instead of just their role. This allows for more flexibility and allows data access control to easily scale without the need to constantly map a user to their role. Using attributes, we can write policies in one place and have them applied across all of our data platforms. This makes for a truly holistic data governance approach and provides immediate ROI and time savings for the company.",

Like many organizations, Effectv's customer lifecycle processes are spread across many systems utilizing various integrations between them. This results in key challenges like duplicate and redundant customer data that requires rationalization and remediation. Data is at the core of Effectv’s modernization journey with the intended result of winning more business, accelerating order fulfillment, reducing make-goods and identifying revenue.\n  \nIn partnership with Slalom Consulting, Comcast Effectv built a traditional lakehouse on Databricks to ingest data from all of these systems but with a twist; they anchored every engineering decision in how it will enable their data governance program. \n  \nIn this talk, we will touch upon the data transformation journey at Effectv and dive deeper into the implementation of data governance leveraging Databricks solutions such as Delta Lake, Unity Catalog and DB SQL. Key focus areas include how we baked master data management into our pipelines by automating the matching and survivorship process, and bringing it all together for the data consumer via DBSQL to use our certified assets in bronze, silver and gold layers.\n  \nBy making thoughtful decisions about structuring data in Unity Catalog and baking MDM into ETL pipelines, you can greatly increase the quality, reliability, and adoption of single-source-of-truth data so your business users can stop spending cycles on wrangling data and spend more time developing actionable insights for your business.",

In this scenario, a cloud scale analytics platform with 7500 active users based on the lakehouse approach is used. In addition, there is potential for 1500 further users who are subject to special governance rules. They are consuming 600+TB of data stored in Delta Lake - continuously growing at more than 1TB per day. This might grow due to local country data.\n Therefore, the existing data platform must be extended to enable users to combine global and local data from their countries. A new data management was required, which reflects the strict information security rules at a need to know base. Core requirements are: read only from global data, write into local and share the results.\n Due to a very pronounced information security awareness and a lack of the technological possibilities it was not possible to interdisciplinary analyze and exchange data so easy or at all so far. Therefore, a lot of business potential and gains could not be identified and realized.\n With the new developments in the technology used and the basis of the Lakehouse approach, thanks to Unity Catalog, we were able to develop a solution that could meet high requirements for security and process. And enables globally secured interdisciplinary data exchange and analysis at scale.\n This solution enables the democratization of the data. This results not only in the ability to gain better insights for business management, but also to generate entirely new business cases or products that require a higher degree of data integration and encourage the culture to change.\n We highlight technical challenges and solutions, present best practices and point out benefits of implementing Unity catalog for enterprises.",

Privacy violation fines are reaching record highs and will only get higher as governments continue to crack down on the runaway abuse of user data. To continue producing value without becoming a liability, data systems must include privacy protections at a foundational level.\n \n The most practical way to do this is to enable privacy as code, shifting privacy left and including it as a foundational part of the organization's software development life cycle. The promise of privacy as code is that data organizations can be liberated from inefficient, manual workflows for producing the compliance deliverables their legal teams need, and instead ship at speed with pre-defined privacy guardrails built into the structure of their preferred workflows.\n \n Despite being an emerging and complex problem, there are already powerful open source tools available designed to help organizations of all sizes achieve this outcome.

On the other side of the equation, the end user who needs access to a data asset may be left waiting for grants to be made as the decision is passed between teams. That is, if they even know the correct path to getting access in the first place.\n  \n Separating the concerns of managing data governance at a business level and implementing data governance at an engineering level is the best way to clarify data access permissions. In practice, this involves building systems to enable data governance enforcement based on business rules, with little to no understanding of the individual system where the data lives. \n \n In practice, with a concrete business rule, such as “only users from the finance team should have access to critical financial data,” we want a system that deals only with those constituent concepts. For example, “the data is marked as critical financial” and “the user is a part of the finance team”).

The Cyber security domain is a good example where datasets come from many different source systems and land in the lakehouse.\n With such a complex dataset ecosystem, answers to simple questions like “Have we ever detected this IP address?” or “Which columns contain IP addresses?” can become impractical and expensive.\n DiscoverX can automate the discovery of all columns that might contain specific patterns, (e.g. IP addresses, MAC addresses, fully qualified domain names, etc.) and automatically generate search and indexing queries that span across multiple tables and columns.",

         "Today, the average Fortune 500 company manages 100+ cybersecurity vendors. The sheer number of enterprise cybersecurity toolsets, each capturing and generating its own data, creates significant data management and data engineering challenges for all enterprises. Because each of these security tools has separate logs, outputs, and databases, it prevents any security team from meaningfully understanding their overall security posture and using their own data effectively. We believe that cybersecurity is fundamentally a data management problem. In this presentation, we will show how treating cybersecurity as a data management problem, and subsequently opening disparate cybersecurity data to queries can help organizations secure their systems and data more effectively. In this presentation, practitioners will walk away understanding the value of modeled and organized security on a data warehouse. We will leverage a real-world use case that shows how Databricks can help solve vulnerability management and end-to-end workflows for security practitioners.",

         "Databricks has been an essential part of the Conde Nast architecture for the last few years.\n \n Prior to building our centralized data platform, “evergreen”, we had similar challenges as many other organizations; siloed data, duplicated efforts for engineers, and a lack of collaboration between data teams. These problems led to mistrust in data sets and made it difficult to scale to meet the strategic globalization plan we had for Conde Nast.\n \n Over the last few years we have been extremely successful in building a centralized data platform on Databricks in AWS, fully embracing the lakehouse vision from end-to-end. Now, our analysts and marketers can derive the same insights from one dataset and data scientists can use the same datasets for use cases such as personalization, subscriber propensity models, churn models and on-site recommendations for our iconic brands.\n \n In this talk, we’ll discuss how we plan to incorporate Unity Catalog and Delta Sharing as the next phase of our globalization mission. The evergreen platform has become the global standard for data processing and analytics at Conde. In order to manage the worldwide data and comply with GDPR requirements, we need to make sure data is processed in the appropriate region and PII data is handled appropriately. At the same time, we need to have a global view of the data to allow us to make business decisions at the global level. We’ll talk about how delta sharing allows us a simple, secure way to share de-identified datasets across regions in order to make these strategic business decisions, while complying with security requirements. Additionally, we’ll discuss how Unity Catalog allows us to secure, govern and audit these datasets in an easy and scalable manner.",

They introduced a new approach to building a low-code framework on the Apache Spark ecosystem, that allows users to create new pipelines quickly, while handling the scale of tens of millions of transactions an hour, fault tolerance, and satisfying rigid security requirements out of the box. The result? Visa’s development cycles shrank from weeks to days and various business teams can now leverage low-latency streaming data.",

         "Unplanned downtime in manufacturing costs firms up to a trillion dollars annually. Time that materials spend sitting on a production line is lost revenue. Even just 15 hours of downtime a week adds up to over 800 hours of downtime yearly. The use of internet of things or IoT devices can cut this time down by providing details of machine metrics. However, IoT predictive maintenance is challenged by the lack of effective, scalable infrastructure and machine learning solutions. IoT data can be the size of multiple terabytes per day and can come in a variety of formats. Furthermore, without any insights and analysis, this data becomes just another table. \n \n The KPMG Databricks IoT Accelerator is an end-to-end solution enabling manufacturing plant operators to have a bird’s eye view of their machines’ health and empowers proactive machine maintenance across their portfolio of IoT devices. The Databricks Accelerator ingests IoT streaming data at scale and implements the Databricks medallion architecture while leveraging delta live tables to clean and process data. Real time machine learning models are developed from IoT machine measurements and are managed in MLflow. The AI predictions and IoT device readings are compiled in the gold table powering downstream dashboards like Tableau. Dashboards inform machine operators of not only machines’ ailments, but action they can take to mitigate issues before they arise.

Just a single simple-looking request that turned itself up into a a-few-month-long hunt to find a more performant query execution planning than ObjectHashAggregateExec that kept falling back to a sort-based aggregation (i.e. the worst possible aggregation runtime performance). It quickly taught us that an aggregation using a custom Scala UDAF cannot be planned other than ObjectHashAggregateExec but at least tasks don't always have to fall back. And that's just batch workloads. When you throw in streaming semantics and think of the different output modes, windowing and streaming watermark optimizing aggregation can take a long time to do right.\n \n During the talk you'll learn the different execution strategies of aggregation (groupBy) in Apache Spark and what issues I faced while hunting down the tiniest performance improvements.

However, many such turn-key solutions face challenges: cost-inefficient EDW targets; inability to evolve schema; forbiddingly expensive data exports due to cloud and vendor lock-in. The alternative: an open data lake that unifies batch and streaming workloads. Increasingly, we must adapt to a multi-cloud reality. Delta Lake decouples data storage from proprietary formats, dramatically reducing data extraction costs. Exporting data from delta tables eliminates the compute and storage API costs required by EDW. Bronze landing zones in Delta format build the foundation for a medallion architecture. Apache Spark™ Structured Streaming provides a unified ingestion strategy. Streaming triggers allow us to switch back and forth between batch and stream with one-line code changes. Streaming aggregation enables us to incrementally compute on data that arrives near each other.\n It is a misconception that streaming requires always-on clusters and thus is prohibitively expensive. Streaming means the ability to automatically handle new data and avoid reprocessing of historical data; real time is optional depending on use cases. Autoloader is a technique to discover newly arrived data and ensure exactly once, incremental processing. DLT further simplifies streaming jobs, accelerating the development cycle.\n Workflows bring it all together and the open source dbx project applies SWE best practices. Workflows can orchestrate tasks such as DLT pipelines, spark jobs, SQL scripts, as well as dbt transformations. Developers can define compute resources, scheduling, and dependencies in descriptive yaml format. Both task definitions and job code are versioned with popular source control systems.",

The ML models need correlated data in real-time so vulnerabilities can be detected instantly and remediation actions can be taken.\n \n The data pipeline comprises of multiple event sources, each one of them producing high volumes of continuous data.

Data need to be replicated to a data warehouse to serve queries doing group-bys, and joins across tables from different systems. At Coinbase, we designed SOON (Spark cOntinuOus iNgestion) based on Kafka, Kafka Connect, and Spark as an incremental table replication solution to replicate tables of any size from any database to Delta Lake in a timely manner. It also supports Kafka events ingestion naturally.\n \n SOON incrementally ingests Kafka events as appends, updates, and deletes to an existing table on Delta Lake. The events are grouped into two categories: CDC (change data capture) events generated by Kafka Connect source connectors, and non-CDC events by the frontend or backend services. Both types can be appended or merged into the Delta Lake. Non-CDC events can be in any format, but CDC events must be in the standard SOON CDC schema. We implemented Kafka Connect SMTs to transform raw CDC events into this standardized format. SOON unifies all streaming ingestion scenarios such that users only need to learn one onboarding experience and the team only needs to maintain one framework.\n \n We care about the ingestion performance. The biggest append-only table onboarded has ingress traffic at hundreds of thousands events per second; the biggest CDC-merge table onboarded has a snapshot size of a few TBs and CDC update traffic at hundreds of events per second.

The main reason is that DS V1 uses column stats, especially number of distinct values (NDV) for query optimization. Currently, Spark DS V2 only has interfaces for data sources to report table statistics such as size in bytes and number of rows. In order to use column stats in DS V2, we have added new interfaces to allow external data sources to report column stats to Spark.

By the multi-fold performance improvement from these solutions, more and more Spark users have started to adopt the new technology. One characteristics of native libraries is that they all use columnar data format as the basic data format. It's because the columnar data format has the intrinsic affinity to vectorized data processing using SIMD instructions. While vanilla Spark's shuffle is based on spark's internal row data format. The high overhead of the columnar to row and row to columnar conversion during the shuffle makes reusing current shuffle not possible. Due to the importance of shuffle service in Spark, we have to implement an efficient columnar shuffle, which brings couple of new challenges, like the split of columnar data, or the dictionary support during shuffle.\n \n In this session, we will share 1) the exploration process of the columnar shuffle design during our Gazelle and Gluten development, and best practices for implementing the columnar shuffle service. We will also share how we learned from the development of vanilla Spark's shuffle, for example, how to address the small files issue then we will propose the new shuffle solution.

To contain and mitigate the spread of the disease in Washington State, the Washington Department of Health data science team used the Databricks platform to develop a modeling pipeline that employed statistical and mathematical techniques to forecast the course of the monkeypox outbreak throughout the state. These models provided actionable information that helped inform decision making and guide the public health response to the outbreak. \n \n We used contact-tracing data, standard line-lists, and published parameters to train a variety of time-series forecasting models, including an ARIMA model, a Poisson regression, and an SEIR compartmental model. We also calculated the daily R-effective rate as an additional output. The compartmental model best fit the reported cases when tested out of sample, but the statistical models were quicker and easier to deploy and helped inform initial decision-making. The R-effective rate was particularly useful throughout the effort. \n \n Overall, these efforts highlighted the importance of rapidly deployable and scalable infectious disease modeling pipelines. Public health data science is still a nascent field, however, so common best practices in other industries are often-times novel approaches in public health. The need for stable, generalizable pipelines is crucial. Using the Databricks platform has allowed us to more quickly scale and iteratively improve our modeling pipelines to include other infectious diseases, such as influenza and RSV. Further development of scalable and standardized approaches to disease forecasting at the state and local level is vital to better informing future public health response efforts.",

         "Using Databricks, we built a “Unified Talent Solution”, backed by a robust data and AI engine for analyzing skills of a combined pool of permanent employees, contractors, part-time employees and vendors, inferring skill gaps, future trends and recommended priority areas to bridge talent gaps, which ultimately greatly improved operational efficiency, transparency, commercial model, and talent experience of our client. We leveraged a variety of ML algorithms such as boosting, neural networks and NLP transformers to provide better AI-driven insights. One inevitable part of developing these models within a typical DS workflow is iteration. Databricks' end-to-end ML/DS workflow service, MLFlow, helped streamline this process by organizing them into experiments that tracked the data used for training/testing, model artifacts, lineage and the corresponding results/metrics. For checking the health of our models using drift detection, bias and explainability techniques, MLFlow's deploying, and monitoring services were leveraged extensively. Our solution built on Databricks platform, simplified ML by defining a data-centric workflow that unified best practices from DevOps, DataOps, and ModelOps. Databricks Feature Store allowed us to productionize our models and features jointly. Insights were done with visually appealing charts and graphs using PowerBI, plotly, matplotlib, that answer business questions most relevant to clients. We built our own advanced custom analytics platform on top of delta lake as Delta’s ACID guarantees allows us to build a real-time reporting app that displays consistent and reliable data - React (for front-end), Structured Streaming for ingesting data from Delta table with live query analytics on real time data ML predictions based on analytics data",

In this session, we introduce MLOps concepts and describe how we implement MLOps principles in our projects at Gucci by leveraging Databricks functionalities. A use case of deploying a data science tool for supporting media budget allocation decisions is presented. After the development of a POC to experiment and effectively address the business problem, the code was versioned and refactored. Code reviews were executed to ensure quality and readability. Within Databricks, we rapidly moved the project to the production stage by achieving an automated solution including unit tests, environment configuration, registration and versioning of models, monitoring of model performances as well as model serving and a dashboard to visualize results. This template is being successfully replicated for other projects and is allowing our new Data Science team to quickly bring value to different business areas of the company.

As a central team, our goal is to standardize the way of working across all of these brands, including the deployment of machine learning models. To this end, we have adopted Databricks as our standard platform for our batch inference models. \n\nHowever, API deployment for real time inference models remained challenging due to the varying capabilities of our brands. Our attempts to standardize API deployments with different tools failed due to complexity of our organization. Fortunately, Databricks has recently introduced a new feature: serverless API deployment. Since all our brands already use Databricks, this feature was easy to adopt. It allows us to easily reuse API deployment across all of our brands, significantly reducing time to market (from 6-12 months to 1 month), increasing efficiency, and reducing the costs.

         "Snowflake and Databricks both aim to provide data science toolkits for machine learning workflows, albeit with different approaches and resources. While developing ML models is technically possible using either platform, the Hitachi Solutions Empower team tested which solution will be easier, faster, and cheaper to work with in terms of both user experience and business outcomes for our customers. To do this, we designed and conducted a series of experiments with use cases from the TPCx-AI benchmark standard. We developed both single-node and multi-node versions of these experiments, which sometimes required us to set up separate compute infrastructure outside of the platform, in the case of Snowflake. We also built datasets of various sizes (1GB, 10GB, and 100GB), to assess how each platform/node setup handles scale. Based on our findings. On the average, Databricks is faster, cheaper, and easier to use for developing machine learning models, and we use it exclusively for data science on the Empower platform. Snowflake’s reliance on third party resources for distributed training is a major drawback, and the need to use multiple compute environments to scale up training is complex and, in our view, an unnecessary complication to achieve best results.",

Most significant is that the barrier to entry has dropped for AI application developers through customizable prompts (few-shot learning), enabling laypeople to generate high-quality content. The flexibility of models like ChatGPT and DALLE-2 have sparked curiosity and creativity about new applications that they can support. The number of tools will continue to grow in a manner similar to how AWS fueled app development.\n \n But excitement must be tampered by concerns about new risks imposed to business and society. Increased capability and adoption also increase risk exposure. As organizations explore creative boundaries of generative models, measures to reduce risk must be put in place. However, the enormous size of the input space and inherent complexity make this task more challenging than traditional ML models.\n \n In this talk, we summarize the new risks introduced by the new class of generative foundation models through several examples, and compare how these risks relate to the risks of mainstream discriminative models. Steps can be taken to reduce the operational risk, bias and fairness issues, and privacy and security of systems that leverage LLM for automation. We’ll explore model hallucinations, output evaluation, output bias, prompt injection, data leakage, stochasticity, and more. We’ll discuss some of the larger issues common to LLMs and show how to test for them.

         "Vector databases such as ElasticSearch and Pinecone offer fast ingestion and querying on vector embeddings with ANNs. However, they typically do not decouple compute and storage, making them hard to integrate in production data stacks. Because data storage in these databases is expensive and not easily accessible, data teams typically maintain ETL pipelines to offload historical embedding data to blob stores. When that data needs to be queried, they get loaded back into the vector database in another ETL process. This is reminiscent of loading data from OLTP database to cloud storage, then loading said data into an OLAP warehouse for offline analytics. Recently, “lakehouse” offerings allow direct OLAP querying on cloud storage, removing the need for the second ETL step. The same could be done for embedding data. While embedding storage in blob stores cannot satisfy the high TPS requirements in online settings, we argue it’s sufficient for offline analytics use cases like slicing and dicing data based on embedding clusters. Instead of loading the embedding data back into the vector database for offline analytics, we propose direct processing on embeddings stored in Parquet files in Delta Lake. You will see that offline embedding workloads typically touch a large portion of the stored embeddings without the need for random access. As a result, the workload is entirely bound by network throughput instead of latency, making it quite suitable for blob storage backends. On a test 1 billion vector dataset, ETL into cloud storage takes around 1 hour on a dedicated GPU instance, while batched nearest neighbor search can be done in under one minute with four CPU instances. We believe future “lakehouses” will ship with native support for these embedding workloads.",

DSP can express high-level programs that bootstrap pipeline-aware demonstrations, search for relevant passages, and generate grounded predictions, systematically breaking down problems into small transformations that the LM and RM can handle more reliably.

    "In this demo, we explored building a multi-stage reasoning system with Databricks' tools and LangChain. We began by introducing common system components and then focused on creating chains for specific tasks like answering user queries and finding DAIS-2023 talks. By the end, participants learned to use LangChain beyond just LLMs and construct sequential chains for multi-stage analyses."
