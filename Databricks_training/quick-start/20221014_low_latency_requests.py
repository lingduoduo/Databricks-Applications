# MAGIC # Training machine learning models on tabular data: an end-to-end example
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC This tutorial covers the following steps:
# MAGIC - Import data from your local machine into the Databricks File System (DBFS)
# MAGIC - Visualize the data using Seaborn and matplotlib
# MAGIC - Run a parallel hyperparameter sweep to train machine learning models on the dataset
# MAGIC - Explore the results of the hyperparameter sweep with MLflow
# MAGIC - Register the best performing model in MLflow
# MAGIC - Apply the registered model to another dataset using a Spark UDF
# MAGIC - Set up model serving for low-latency requests
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In this example, you build a model to predict the quality of Portugese "Vinho Verde" wine based on the wine's physicochemical properties. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The example uses a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, presented in [*Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923609001377?via%3Dihub) [Cortez et al., 2009].

# MAGIC %md ## Import data
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC In this section, you download a dataset from the web and upload it to Databricks File System (DBFS).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 1. Navigate to https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/ and download both `winequality-red.csv` and `winequality-white.csv` to your local machine.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 1. From this Databricks notebook, select *File* > *Upload Data*, and drag these files to the drag-and-drop target to upload them to the Databricks File System (DBFS). 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC     **Note**: if you don't have the *File* > *Upload Data* option, you can load the dataset from the Databricks example datasets. Uncomment and run the last two lines in the following cell.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 1. Click *Next*. Some auto-generated code to load the data appears. Select *pandas*, and copy the example code. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 1. Create a new cell, then paste in the sample code. It will look similar to the code shown in the following cell. Make these changes:
# MAGIC   - Pass `sep=';'` to `pd.read_csv`
# MAGIC   - Change the variable names from `df1` and `df2` to `white_wine` and `red_wine`, as shown in the following cell.

# COMMAND ----------

# If you have the File > Upload Data menu option, follow the instructions in the previous cell to upload the data from your local machine.
# The generated code, including the required edits described in the previous cell, is shown here for reference.

import pandas as pd

# In the following lines, replace <username> with your username.
white_wine = pd.read_csv("/dbfs/FileStore/shared_uploads/lhuang@themeetgroup.com/winequality_white.csv", sep=';')
red_wine = pd.read_csv("/dbfs/FileStore/shared_uploads/lhuang@themeetgroup.com/winequality_red.csv", sep=';')

# If you do not have the File > Upload Data menu option, uncomment and run these lines to load the dataset.

#white_wine = pd.read_csv("/dbfs/databricks-datasets/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv", sep=";")
#red_wine = pd.read_csv("/dbfs/databricks-datasets/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv", sep=";")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Merge the two DataFrames into a single dataset, with a new binary feature "is_red" that indicates whether the wine is red or white.

# COMMAND ----------

red_wine['is_red'] = 1
white_wine['is_red'] = 0

data = pd.concat([red_wine, white_wine], axis=0)

# Remove spaces from column names
data.rename(columns=lambda x: x.replace(' ', '_'), inplace=True)

# COMMAND ----------

data.head()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ## Visualize data
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Before training a model, explore the dataset using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Plot a histogram of the dependent variable, quality.

# COMMAND ----------

import seaborn as sns
sns.distplot(data.quality, kde=False)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Looks like quality scores are normally distributed between 3 and 9. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Define a wine as high quality if it has quality >= 7.

# COMMAND ----------

high_quality = (data.quality >= 7).astype(int)
data.quality = high_quality

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Box plots are useful in noticing correlations between features and a binary label.

# COMMAND ----------

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

dims = (3, 4)

f, axes = plt.subplots(dims[0], dims[1], figsize=(25, 15))
axis_i, axis_j = 0, 0
for col in data.columns:
  if col == 'is_red' or col == 'quality':
    continue # Box plots cannot be used on indicator variables
  sns.boxplot(x=high_quality, y=data[col], ax=axes[axis_i, axis_j])
  axis_j += 1
  if axis_j == dims[1]:
    axis_i += 1
    axis_j = 0

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md In the above box plots, a few variables stand out as good univariate predictors of quality. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - In the alcohol box plot, the median alcohol content of high quality wines is greater than even the 75th quantile of low quality wines. High alcohol content is correlated with quality.
# MAGIC - In the density box plot, low quality wines have a greater density than high quality wines. Density is inversely correlated with quality.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ## Preprocess data
# MAGIC Prior to training a model, check for missing values and split the data into training and validation sets.

# COMMAND ----------

data.isna().any()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md There are no missing values.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Prepare dataset for training baseline model
# MAGIC Split the input data into 3 sets:
# MAGIC - Train (60% of the dataset used to train the model)
# MAGIC - Validation (20% of the dataset used to tune the hyperparameters)
# MAGIC - Test (20% of the dataset used to report the true performance of the model on an unseen dataset)

# COMMAND ----------

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X = data.drop(["quality"], axis=1)
y = data.quality

# Split out the training data
X_train, X_rem, y_train, y_rem = train_test_split(X, y, train_size=0.6, random_state=123)

# Split the remaining data equally into validation and test
X_val, X_test, y_val, y_test = train_test_split(X_rem, y_rem, test_size=0.5, random_state=123)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ## Build a baseline model
# MAGIC This task seems well suited to a random forest classifier, since the output is binary and there may be interactions between multiple variables.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md You logged the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) to MLflow. Click **Experiment** at the upper right to display the Experiment Runs sidebar.

# MAGIC #### Use MLflow to view the results
# MAGIC Open up the Experiment Runs sidebar to see the MLflow runs. Click on Date next to the down arrow to display a menu, and select 'auc' to display the runs sorted by the auc metric. The highest auc value is 0.90.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC MLflow tracks the parameters and performance metrics of each run. Click the External Link icon <img src="https://docs.databricks.com/_static/images/icons/external-link.png"/> at the top of the Experiment Runs sidebar to navigate to the MLflow Runs Table.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Now investigate how the hyperparameter choice correlates with AUC. Click the "+" icon to expand the parent run, then select all runs except the parent, and click "Compare". Select the Parallel Coordinates Plot.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The Parallel Coordinates Plot is useful in understanding the impact of parameters on a metric. You can drag the pink slider bar at the upper right corner of the plot to highlight a subset of AUC values and the corresponding parameter values. The plot below highlights the highest AUC values:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC <img src="https://docs.databricks.com/_static/images/mlflow/end-to-end-example/parallel-coordinates-plot.png"/>
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Notice that all of the top performing runs have a low value for reg_lambda and learning_rate. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC You could run another hyperparameter sweep to explore even lower values for these parameters. For simplicity, that step is not included in this example.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC You used MLflow to log the model produced by each hyperparameter configuration. The following code finds the best performing run and saves the model to Model Registry.

# COMMAND ----------

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md #### Update the production `wine_quality` model in MLflow Model Registry
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Earlier, you saved the baseline model to Model Registry with the name `wine_quality`. Now that you have a created a more accurate model, update `wine_quality`.

# COMMAND ----------

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ##Batch inference
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC There are many scenarios where you might want to evaluate a model on a corpus of new data. For example, you may have a fresh batch of data, or may need to compare the performance of two models on the same corpus of data.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The following code evaluates the model on data stored in a Delta table, using Spark to run the computation in parallel.

# COMMAND ----------

# To simulate a new corpus of data, save the existing X_train data to a Delta table. 
# In the real world, this would be a new batch of data.

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The following code illustrates how to issue requests using a REST API to get predictions from the deployed model.

# COMMAND ----------
