# MAGIC # Welcome to the Databricks ML Workshop!
# MAGIC #### Today we're going to cover some key areas on how you do machine learning while on the lakehouse.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We'll be using some financial data and putting ourselves in the shoes of a data scientist/ML engineer to see what 
# MAGIC tools are available to use within the lakehouse and how they all tie together.  
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Some highlights that we'll hit:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Data Prep and DataOps
# MAGIC * Read/Write with Delta
# MAGIC * Bounce between SQL and Python
# MAGIC * Visualizations
# MAGIC * Saving to Feature Store
# MAGIC #### Experimentation and ModelOps
# MAGIC * Set up MLflow experiment
# MAGIC * Run experiment and train model
# MAGIC * Browse results
# MAGIC * Register Model
# MAGIC * AutoML
# MAGIC * Explore MLflow Model Registry
# MAGIC #### Deployment and DevOps
# MAGIC * Model Registry
# MAGIC * Batch Inference
# MAGIC * Model Serving

# COMMAND ----------

#Lets set up the user specific prefixes

#Ideally we'd be using a Unity Catalog here - but for workshop purposes we'll use the default catalog
#If you run this notebook on UC, you can simply point to your catalog here
catalog = "hive_metastore"
dbutils.widgets.text("catalog", catalog)

#This is just getting the user ID for the workshop so everyone is split
user_id = dbutils.notebook.entry_point.getDbutils().notebook().getContext().userName().get()
user_id = ''.join(filter(str.isdigit, user_id))

schema_name = 'user' + user_id
dbutils.widgets.text("schema_name", schema_name)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC --To ensure everyone in the workshop has a good experience, we'll break everyone into their own schema
# MAGIC --If this errors, please go to the above cell and change "schema_name" then rerun
# MAGIC CREATE SCHEMA ${schema_name}

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC DROP SCHEMA ${schema_name}

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Data Prep and DataOps
# MAGIC Our example dataset exists on our workspace already as a directory of parquet files.  
# MAGIC In practice, we could be looking at ingest from any number of locations, such as a Delta Live Table, but this was chosen for simplicity 

# COMMAND ----------

#load in the loan data from the parquet dir 
loan = spark.read.parquet('/databricks-datasets/samples/lending_club/parquet/')

#then save it as a delta table for future use
loan.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable(f"{catalog}.{schema_name}.loan_data")

# COMMAND ----------

#we can do spark queries for some very basic exploration
data = spark.table(f"{catalog}.{schema_name}.loan_data").limit(1000000)
display(data)

#but if we're writing SQL, we can do better

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC Select * from ${catalog}.${schema_name}.loan_data limit 1000

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC What if I want to explore my data via a UI?

# COMMAND ----------

pip install bamboolib

# COMMAND ----------

import bamboolib as bam
#Jump into bamboolib and explore the dataframe
df_explore = spark.table(f"{catalog}.{schema_name}.loan_data").limit(1000000).toPandas()
df_explore

# COMMAND ----------

import pandas as pd; import numpy as np
# Reload data
df_explore = spark.table(f"{catalog}.{schema_name}.loan_data").limit(1000000).toPandas()
# Step: Drop columns with missing values
df_explore = df_explore.dropna(how='all', axis=1)
# Step: Group by addr_state and calculate new column(s)
df_annual_income = df_explore.groupby(['addr_state']).agg(annual_inc_mean=('annual_inc', 'mean')).reset_index()

# COMMAND ----------

#Lets take our data and visualize it inline
display(df_annual_income)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### Now lets take our loan data and set up an example problem to solve
# MAGIC Since we have a large dataset lets focus the problem down to a specific ask.  
# MAGIC Can we reasonably estimate, given the provided data, a specific loan's status?  
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We're going to define an account that has been 'charged_off' - in which the creditor has stopped trying to collect debts from an account as a 'bad_loan'

# COMMAND ----------

#Re-load the full dataset from our delta table
df = spark.table(f"{catalog}.{schema_name}.loan_data").limit(1000000)

#Create new feature "bad_loan" representing accounts that have been charged off
loan_stats_df = df.filter(df.loan_status.isin(["Default", "Charged Off", "Fully Paid"])).withColumn("bad_loan",(df.loan_status == "Charged Off").cast("string"))
loan_stats_df = loan_stats_df.toPandas()

#Remove null data
loan_stats_df = loan_stats_df.dropna(how='all', axis=1)

#Create unique key 
loan_stats_df['id'] = loan_stats_df.index

display(loan_stats_df)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### Let's use this data to populate our Feature Store
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For others, including our future selves, to be able to make use of these features and better track lineage, let's put our newly created features into the feature store.

# COMMAND ----------

  #drop table if exists
  fs.drop_table(f"{catalog}.{schema_name}.loan_features")

#actually write the table to the feature store

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### Lets go look at the Feature Store in the sidebar to see where our table ended up

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Experimentation and ModelOps
# MAGIC Now that we've done some data exploration and we've extracted our features into the feature store, lets do something with them.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We have data and a goal, can we classify these loans?

# COMMAND ----------

#first lets build a simple dataset that brings in our loans that we want to categorize
#since we're building the training dataset, we're assuming the outcome exists here as well (bad_loan)

loan_ids = spark.sql(f"select id, bad_loan from {catalog}.{schema_name}.loan_features")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Now that our data looks ready to go, lets use a popular library to train a classifier and see if we can create a model with just a few inputs that can reliably estimate if a loan's status is bad.  
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For this example, we're going to use LightGBM. LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithms. It is one of many, many approaches/methods one could use to train a model with this data and we use it here simply as an example.
