# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md # Install Datasets
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We need to "install" the datasets this course uses by copying them from their current location in the cloud to a location relative to your workspace.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC All that is required is to run the following cell. By default, the **`Classroom-Setup`** script will not reinstall the datasets upon <br/>subsequent invocation but this behavior can be adjusted by modifying the parameters below.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Feel free to leave this notebook running and proceed with the course while the install completes in the background.
