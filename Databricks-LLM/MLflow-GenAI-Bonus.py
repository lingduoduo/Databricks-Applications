# MAGIC ## HuggingFace transformers library is supported as an MLflow model flavor
# MAGIC #### This means it's super easy to grab awesome models off the shelf and use them right away.
# MAGIC #### Lets prove this by grabbing a language model for summarization in just one cell!

# COMMAND ----------

import transformers
import mlflow

#This is the specific model we're going to use, but can grab any huggingface hosted model
summary_pipeline = transformers.pipeline(model="sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6")

#Now that huggingface is supported in MLflow, we can create a new MLflow run to log our model
with mlflow.start_run() as run:
  mlflow.transformers.log_model(
    transformers_model=summary_pipeline,
    artifact_path="summary_bot",
    input_example="Some kind of long form text that mostly talks about camera lenses."
  )

# With the model now logged, we can easily load it into a simple python function!
model_uri = f"runs:/{run.info.run_id}/summary_bot"

# The end result is a chatbot object that not only responds to user prompts, but even remembers context
summarizer = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(model_uri)

# MAGIC #### Let's use an example customer review that's rather long, and see if we can get a decent summary.

# COMMAND ----------

customer_feedback = "I've been using the Sony 24-70mm lens for a while now, and wow, it's a game changer! No matter if I'm doing portraits or capturing the great outdoors, this lens has my back. Seriously, the versatility of the zoom range is awesome. Even in tricky light, the images come out super clear and sharp - the aperture range doesn't disappoint. I was worried about distortions, but there's barely any, which is great. And can we talk about the autofocus? Super quick and quiet. Really helpful when you're trying to catch those fleeting moments. In terms of build, it's solid and feels good in the hand. All in all, the Sony 24-70mm lens is worth every penny. If you're looking to step up your photography, this lens should be on your radar. Love it!"

# MAGIC ### Since it's so easy, why not try out a few different models from Huggingface?
# MAGIC #### This time, we'll grab a chatbot. We can use almost the same code, too.

# COMMAND ----------

#This is the specific model we're going to use, but can grab any huggingface hosted model

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Just like that, we have a model loaded up and ready to go. Let's take it for a test drive.

# COMMAND ----------

first_response = chatbot.predict("What's the best way to get to Antarctica?")

# COMMAND ----------

display(first_response)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC ### Okay, a solid answer. Now lets see if it can remember context...

# COMMAND ----------

second_response = chatbot.predict("What kind of boat would I need?")

# COMMAND ----------

print(second_response)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC ### Look at that, it remembered from our first question! 
# MAGIC #### Lets reload the model and show that without context, the answer differs.

# COMMAND ----------

#reload the chatbot
chatbot = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(model_uri) 

# COMMAND ----------

#Lets ask it the second question again, but without asking about Antarctica first
