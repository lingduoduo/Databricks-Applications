 ## Cluster Overview & Types
 
 - Standard and Single Node clusters 
 - Terminate automatically after 120 minutes by default
 - High Concurrency clusters do not terminate automatically by default.
 - Autoscaling typically reduces costs compared to a fixed-size cluster
 - Use single node for experimenting to control cost. Best practices (use spot and on-demand, enable autoscaling)
