    "# Lab: Data Skipping and Liquid Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we are going to work with Liquid Clustering, a Delta Lake optimization feature that replaces table partitioning and ZORDER to simplify data layout decisions and optimize query performance. It provides flexibility to redefine clustering keys without rewriting data. Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta/clustering.html) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning Objectives\n",
    "**By the end of this lab, you will be able to:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Disable Spark caching to observe the effects of Liquid Clustering.\n",
    "* Count records and explore data in the flights tables.\n",
    "* Execute queries on an unclustered table and analyze their performance using Spark UI.\n",
    "* Execute and compare queries on tables clustered by different columns (**id** and **id** + **FlightNum**).\n",
    "* Inspect query performance using the Spark UI to understand the benefits of Liquid Clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "In order to follow along with this lab, you will need:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Basic knowledge of running SQL queries in Databricks is required.\n",
    "* Familiarity with Delta Lake and its optimization features is recommended.\n"

    "\n",
    "* Tables often filtered by high cardinality columns.\n",

    "* Tables that grow quickly and require maintenance and tuning effort.\n",

    "* Tables with access patterns that change over time.\n",
    "* Tables where a typical partition key could leave the table with too many or too few partitions.\n",
